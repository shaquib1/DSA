// Mode of inheritance 

// 1. Public mode:If we derive a subclass from a publicbase class. Then, the base classâ€™s public members will become public in the derived class, 
//    and protected class members will become protected in the derived class.


// 2. Protected mode:If we derive a subclass from a Protected base class. Then both public members 
//    and protected members of the base class will become protected in the derived class. 


// 3. Private mode:If we derive a subclass from a Privatebase class. Then both public members 
//    and protected members of the base class will become Private in the derived class.
